EasyGiftSelection
=================

This application allows consumer to enter the number of gifts he wants to purchase and the total cost of all gifts.

When a consumer is buying gifts, 2 things are important to him - the number of gifts and the total cost of gifts. This application allows consumer to enter these two parameters and then displays the items matching this criteria. Zappos APIs are used to populate the items list. The received json file is parsed and the resultant items are displayed. Also the results are saved in file.
